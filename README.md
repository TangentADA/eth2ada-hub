# Cardano-to-Ethereum Dictionary Registry

Welcome to the open-source registry for the **Cardano-to-Ethereum Dictionary**, available at [https://eth2ada.com](https://eth2ada.com). This project is a community-driven initiative to define and compare blockchain terms across the Cardano and Ethereum ecosystems‚Äîhighlighting their similarities, differences, and unique features in a clear and accessible way.

---

## üìö Background

This dictionary serves as a dynamic resource to help developers, researchers, and blockchain enthusiasts better understand key concepts across Cardano and Ethereum. Topics include:

- Consensus mechanisms  
- Transaction models  
- Smart contract paradigms  

The dictionary is stored as a JavaScript array of objects inside `data/news_data.js`. A public frontend at [eth2ada.com](https://eth2ada.com) renders this data, and the GitHub repo at [github.com/TangentADA/eth2ada-rc](https://github.com/TangentADA/eth2ada-rc) is open for contributions via Pull Requests (PRs).

We welcome input from anyone with a GitHub account. Let‚Äôs educate and connect both communities together!

### ‚úÖ Adding a New Term

### Adding a New Term

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Click ‚ÄúFork‚Äù on [github.com/TangentADA/eth2ada-rc](https://github.com/TangentADA/eth2ada-rc).

2. **Clone Your Fork**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/eth2ada-rc.git
   cd eth2ada-rc
   
3. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-term-<term-name>       

Replace <term-name> with a short identifier (e.g., utxo).

4. **Edit the Dictionary**
   
Append a new object to data/news_data.js with a comma and this structure:  

   ```javascript
   {
        id: "term_7",
        title: "DApp",
        text: "A decentralized application running on a blockchain...",
        description: "On Cardano, DApps use Plutus scripts for decentralized logic, validated by the network.",
        descriptionETH: "On Ethereum, DApps rely on smart contracts deployed on the blockchain.",
        image: "/images/blog/term_7.jpg",
        date: "10 Apr",
        time: "2 min read",
        subImages: ["/images/blog/gallery_1.jpg"],
        authorImage: "/images/logo-circle.png",
        authorName: "Eth2Ada Academy"
   }
```

5. **Commit the Changes**

   ```bash
   git add data/news_data.js
   git commit -m "Add new term: DApp"
```
```


Push to GitHub  

  ```bash
   git push origin add-term-<term-name>
```

6. **Submit a Pull Request**

From your fork, create a PR comparing your branch to the main repo‚Äôs main branch. Include a clear title and description.


### Editing an Existing Term

Fork and clone the repo as above.
Create a branch:

```bash
   git checkout -b edit-term-<term-name>
```

Update the relevant object in data/news_data.js.
Commit, push, and submit a PR as described.
